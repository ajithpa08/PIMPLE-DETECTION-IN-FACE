We are thrilled to unveil our latest innovation‚Äîa cutting-edge pimple detection tool powered by state-of-the-art image processing techniques. Perfect for skincare analysis and dermatology applications, here's a glimpse of what it offers:
üñºÔ∏è Region of Interest (ROI) Selection: Users can pinpoint specific areas in images for analysis, allowing focused examination.
üîç Image Processing: Our tool applies advanced image processing, including thresholding, contour detection, and color analysis, to identify potential pimples accurately.
üì∑ Image Saving: Processed images are saved with marked pimples, each with a unique timestamped filename.
üí° Real-time Feedback: Users receive immediate results with processed images displaying detected pimples and the total count.

Here's a brief breakdown of the code's key steps In Goggle Colab:
1. CNN Model Definition: We've crafted a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model for image classification, with multiple layers and full compatibility for training.
2. Data Preprocessing: Image data is meticulously prepared using data augmentation techniques, and it's organized into training and testing sets.
3. Model Training: Our CNN model is trained on the prepared image data for a specific number of epochs.
4. Model Saving: The trained model is saved for future use and reference.
5. Data Loading: The code efficiently loads image data from folders with a predefined structure.
6. Accuracy Calculation: We calculate model accuracy by comparing predicted and true labels.
7. Random Forest Classifier: A Random Forest Classifier is trained on a synthetic dataset to enhance accuracy.
8. Initial Accuracy: We showcase the initial accuracy of the Random Forest Classifier.
9. Hyperparameter Tuning: Utilizing GridSearchCV, we optimize hyperparameters for the Random Forest Classifier.
10. Tuned Model: A new Random Forest Classifier with tuned hyperparameters is trained.
11. Accuracy after Tuning: We present the improved accuracy achieved after hyperparameter tuning.

This code encompasses the entire journey of creating, training, and evaluating machine learning models, combining a CNN for image classification with a Random Forest Classifier for synthetic data.
